    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is Eastern European in origin; being from Bosnia, my mom made this for me
        growing up and my whole family always looked forward to it! Serve with Balkan style yogurt 
        for authenticity.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground allspice </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika </li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 potato, finely chopped </li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped </li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough </li>
        <li>Â¼ cup melted butter </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Brown ground beef in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat, 5 to 7 minutes.
            Drain fat; stir in allspice, paprika, salt, and pepper. Transfer beef to a large bowl and
            stir in potato and onion.</li>
        <li>Unroll phyllo pastry and transfer 2 sheets to a work surface; stack sheets. Spoon 1/8th of
            the ground beef mixture down one long edge of the phyllo pastry. Roll phyllo into a tube,
            encasing beef. Shape the tube into a coil (snail shape). Place the roll on an ungreased
            baking sheet; brush with melted butter. Repeat, placing finished rolls up against one another
            to keep them from unrolling.</li>
        <li>Bake burek in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
